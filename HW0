#Steven Ho's First CS193 Homework
- I enjoy the fact that the class is led by fellow students who have recently gone through what I have
- I enjoy the fact that the class has so far had a lot of fun moments such as the entertaining questions and polls
- The material so far isn't too bad so I enjoy that as well
